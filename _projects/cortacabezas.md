In 2005, the President of Colombia received a letter from the Association of Indigenous Councils of the Amazon Trapezium to take charge of investigating strange events in their territory.

They indicated that for years fishermen of the region felt persecuted by a foreign presence that using technology was lurking in the jungle to decapitate them and steal their organs. They call it Cortacabezas.
