This exhibition is conceived as a succession of shots from a movie. It is a film settled down in space; a montage of time-images translated into the context of the exhibition.
<br>
<br>
In the scenes created by each artist beats a panorama. Crossed by memories, flows, and influences of ghosts-stars, horse-dragons, factory-husbands, grandmother- anarchists, body-intervals, cage-canes, and other visual deformations inherited from family mythologies of the rural, the mountains and the countryside. They summon a political fraud: bonfires, kitchens, bandits, tunnels, bombings, and riots, reconstructed by the media, transmitted by social networks, and intervened by artificial intelligences. Here, they are set up as sequence shots of the same cinematic experience at a crossroads.
<br>
<br>
I: Seven people rebel against state violence and carry out a revolution that lasts only one day. There are not many files on the event. Just a couple of photos. One and many anarchist grandmothers remember these stories.
<br>
<br>
II: In the countryside, a man who returns home is murdered due to ideological differences. His memory lurks like a mythological animal.
<br>
<br>
III: A woman marries a factory that ends up revealing a relationship between progress and chastity. The women workers carry out a strike. As part of their requests, they demand that they be allowed to wear shoes inside the factory, that the foremen who sexually harass them be dismissed, that the 12 hour working days be reduced and that they be given one hour for lunch.
<br>
<br>
IV: A woman distrusts sugar cane. She doesnt really know why, but she knows that this monoculture is a huge artificial cage.
<br>
<br>
V: A space trip of a subject fleeing war, global apartheid and slavery ends up being the projection of a lifeless body that travels through a river of memories and latent revolutions in the midst of multiple murders. Here, it is resolved in the figure of a modern myth of resistance to extractivism in the jungle.
<br>
<br>
VI: On the border, innumerable bodies pass through a territory that recalls the passage from life to death. But this passage is so arbitrary that it reminds us that the image also has borders.
<br>
<br>
VII: A succession of filmic correspondences on the territory. Under the sun, only glimpses of an impossible and bizarre map of attempts to win gather in a story that repeats itself in each memory. The human cost of development, or the persistence of a degraded image of reality. It is through these image standards that we examine the projected remains of material and present territories of Tolima, Norte de Santander, Vichada, Chocó and others that are part of an experience of multiple limits: the territory of the film and that of the screen, their colonization, their techniques, their lives and their ways.
<br>
<br>
This exhibition presents a digression from blunt, animated frames, with cut-out texts, titles, and subtitles that fit into the framework of a mountain of memories that would otherwise remain unregistered, untraced, unrelated, and without aspect. Just like many minimal revolutions that continue to develop day by day when walking territories that have been measured, tracked, controlled, and occupied.
<br>
<br>
The narratives that are framed are the remnant of a trauma. They are not assuring or reporting the facts with fidelity, loyalty, or correctness. They are opening a way to consider present actions or feel the repetition and the archetype of the drama that is framed on the screens. Something that, in advance and in a material way, affects all images made by technical means or transmitted by them, whether in film, video, photography or painting. Any plane that has been concerned with portraying a territory according to this general digitalisation process has had to face, consciously or unconsciously, the Aspect Ratio. A technical term that here, at least, becomes manifest and, at the same time, political.
