We are a creative laboratory in Cinema, Visual Arts, and Expanded Theater.
<br/><br/>
We have carried out projects inhabited by an intense exploration of the notion of archive and counter-archive linked to processes of historical memory, narratives about the revolution, resistance, science fiction, colonization, politics, and radical otherness. Our practices are updated through an intense dialogue based on the artist's craft and cinematic experimentation with analog and hybrid formats.
